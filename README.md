## Getting Started  

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the repo**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/sumeetpatil01/Quick-Commerce.git
    ```

3. **(Optional)** Create and activate a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/) (you may want to use [virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/)).

4. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Create a development database**:
    ```sh
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6. If everything is alright, you should be able to start the Django development server:
   In your project directory, activate the virtual environment using the command `env\Scripts\activate`, then open the project where your `manage.py` file is located and run:
   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver


7. Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000, and you will be greeted with a welcome page.
